1. Makefile included will compile the source code for Galileo board. In order to compile it for host machine, use command "gcc assignment_01.c -pthread". Unfortunately, I could not figure out how to use environmental variables on time.
2. The program prints the logs to the console, in order to print it to log file use "./assignment.o > logfile.txt"

During execution,
First enter the number of threads and the total time out for the program. 

Then on each line enter <X A1 A2 A3 A4> where X is A/P depending upon whether the task is periodic or aperiodic. A1 is the priority of the task. A2 is the period for periodic task and event (0/1) for aperiodic task. A3 is the x_min and A4 is x_max for the busy loop iteration. 

After entering the paramters for all the threads, enter 'x' to exit inputting. 

Please change the MOUSEFILE MACRO in order to change the mouse file.
