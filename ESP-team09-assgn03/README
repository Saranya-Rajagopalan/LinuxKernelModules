Galileo Board setup:
1. Power the board and boot the Yocto Embedded linux from SD card
2. Connect the board with the host computer via Ethernet and set the ipaddress of the ethernet port to 192.168.1.* and set the host ethernet address also to 192.168.1.*. 
3. Set up screen
4. Connect the USB mouse to the Intel Galileo Gen 2 board. By default IO pins 0,1,2 are configured as the Red, Green and Blue Led pins. So connect the R, G, B pins of the led to the corresponding IO pins. 


Running the assignment code:
1. Run the make file from the zip file. 
2. It will generate the kernel module files and the compiled object file for the user test application
3. Transfer the files "RGBLed.ko" and "test" to Galileo board. 
4. Insert the module using "insmod ~/RGBLed.ko" command
5. Run the test file using ./test
6. Click mouse button to reset the cycle
7. Press Ctrl+C to exit the test code
8. Remove module using "rmmod RGBLed"


Note: The first cycle of LED would not glow in regular intervals because they are still in setup phase.
