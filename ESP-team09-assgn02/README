1. Run the make file to cross-compile. 
2. It will generate two independent applications RGBLed1 and RGBLed2. Transfer it to Galileo Gen2 board through serial connection
3. On the board, run ./RGBLed1 50 0 1 2. The command line arguments are duty_cycle RedLed_pin GreenLed_pin and BlueLed_pin in order. Connect the Led's to the board. The command line arguments are the same for both the applications. 
4. For the first application, a parallel thread is running to wait for mouse click events and reset the cycle. For the second application, a parallel thread is running for mouse click events but the left mouse click would increase the brightness of the led and the right mouse click would decrease the brightness. 



In the last minute, I could not get the pwm code working- could not identify the mistake. So Including the third non-working file as well RGBLed_pwm.c. 

NOTE: 

The 'MOUSE' file is hardcoded in the file as MOUSEFILE. If the mouse file is not found, kindly change the mouse file name in the code. 

/*
FOR MY APPLICATION, I HAVE USED Gpio_func.c THAT IS ADOPTED FROM RIDGERUN's GPIO_INT_TEST.
